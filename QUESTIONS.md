## Questions

In no particular order please:

1. You say "more like a web application", do you mean you'd like it to look and feel like one, but really just an HTML page OR an actual SPA?

2. Would you prefer I use `bs-202000-l3.html` or `bs-202000.html` as a starting point?

3. Current implementation contains a lot of JS, font & CSS dependencies. Do we need to use any of them? 

4. What limitations are there on using other/new dependencies?

5. In some places, there are `total: 2` and `nested: 2`, does this / should this be rendered?

6. What bookmark capabilities are required, e.g. main headings, all headings, ANY element?

7. What deadline do you/we have on this being delivered?

8. What is the physical deliverable required?

9. What browser support is required?

10. What device support (screen size & orientation) is required?

11. Is any authentication required, user login, oAuth etc.?

12. Should we have a _Reset All_ / _Start Over_ piece of functionality or is refreshing the page sufficient?

13. Current implementation has inline CSS, something I am keen to avoid, would this be an issue?

14. What is the inputs (apart from checklist)?

15. What are the outputs?

16. How will it be tested (outwith my testing)?

17. The current implementation(s) use a CSS reset, is this something that is important or am I free to do it my way?

18. I see a mention of `MathJax` in current implementation, is this required?

19. I see a mention of Font Awesome (icons) but no need for them in the document? Safe to remove?

20. You have previously mentioned print version of this, does THIS need to be able to be printed?
