            Standard cannot confer immunity from legal obligations.
            0 INTRODUCTION 0.1 General Standardization management (SM) is a
            critical enabler for improved cooperation and plays an integral part
            in the activities of organizations (3.19). SM outcomes are a key
            element in capability development activities and for the improvement
            of the competitiveness of industry. SM ensures capability has the
            flexibility and agility to be upgraded incrementally and deliver the
            required levels of coherence and interoperability. SM is therefore
            key to the delivery of the benefits of open procurement by driving
            the use of common open principles, rules and standards through its
            policy, processes and tools. SM is a through-life process that
            enables the drafting, development and maintenance of standards. It
            promotes the intelligent selection and implementation of standards,
            policy, processes and tools, and delivers: enhanced product and
            service safety, quality (product qualification in some sectors) and
            process efficiencies; optimization of the variety of products and
            services; facilitation of increased interoperability of products,
            services and processes; increased exchange of information between
            organizations and dissemination of technology; improved
            compatibility of products and services in international markets,
            reducing transaction costs and enhancing the export performance and
            prestige of organizations; improved governance and assurance; NOTE
            1 Continuous improvement of SM practice ensures that the quality of
            products and services can be assured. Employing validated standards
            enables consistent definition of the performance criteria review for
            products and services, with associated benefits when verifying
            compliance with system requirements. defined and adaptable system
            architectures; NOTE 2 Specified by technical constraints that enable
            a modular and open approach to design, organizations accrue the
            cost-benefits associated with open procurement of products and
            services and the ability to integrate advanced technologies. clear
            accountability and reduced risk; and NOTE 3 This enables
            organizations to perform the role of an intelligent customer,
            setting rigorous, robust, realistic and stable product and service
            requirements for suppliers as well as verifying and validating the
            delivered product or service. standards evolution. NOTE 4 Learning
            from experience develops an organization’s ability to identify,
            assess and specify future capability requirements so that they align
            with technology developments. 0.2 Aims This British Standard
            supports and guides organizations in the implementation of a
            standardization management system (SMS), including assisting
            organizations to: understand the requirements of an SMS; and select
            and implement improvements within an SMS. 0.3 Success factors The
            success of an SMS depends on commitment from all levels and
            functions of the organization, led by top management. The
            organization can leverage opportunities to implement compliance and
            standards that enhance beneficial standardization impacts,
            particularly those with strategic and competitive implications. Top
            management can effectively address risks and opportunities by
            integrating SM into the organization’s business processes, strategic
            direction and decision making, aligning them with other business
            priorities and incorporating standardization governance into its
            overall management system. Demonstration of successful
            implementation of this British Standard can be used to assure
            interested parties that an effective SMS is in place. Adoption of
            this British Standard, however, does not in itself guarantee optimal
            standardization outcomes. Application of this British Standard can
            differ from one organization to another due to the context of each
            organization. Two organizations can carry out similar activities but
            can have different compliance obligations, commitments in their
            standardization policy, standards technologies and SM performance
            goals, yet both can conform to the requirements of this British
            Standard. The level of detail and complexity of the SMS varies
            depending on the context of the organization, the scope of its SMS,
            its compliance obligations, and the nature of its activities,
            products and services, including its standardization aspects and
            associated standardization impacts. 0.4 Continuous improvement of
            the SMS The basis for an SMS is the concept of “Plan-Do-Check-Act”
            (PDCA). The PDCA model provides an iterative process used by
            organization to achieve continual improvement. It can be applied to
            an SMS and to each of its individual elements and can be described
            as follows. Plan: establish the SM objectives and processes
            necessary to deliver results in accordance with the organization’s
            standardization policy. Do: implement the processes as planned.
            Check: monitor and measure the processes against the standardization
            policy, including the organization’s commitments, standardization
            objectives and operating criteria, and report the results. Act: take
            actions to continually improve. Figure 1 shows how the framework
            introduced in this British Standard could be integrated into a PDCA
            model, which can help new and existing users to understand the
            importance of a systems approach. Figure 1 — Relationship between
            PDCA and the standardization management framework 0.5 Contents of
            this standard This British Standard includes a high-level structure,
            identical core text and common terms with core definitions, designed
            to benefit users implementing multiple management systems. This
            British Standard does not include requirements specific to other
            management systems, such as quality, occupational health and safety,
            energy or financial management. However, this British Standard
            enables an organization to use a common approach and risk based
            thinking to integrate its SMS with the requirements of other
            management systems. An organization that wants to make a public
            claim of compliance this British Standard can do so by: making a
            self-determination and self-declaration; or seeking confirmation of
            its conformity by parties having an interest in the organization,
            such as customers; or seeking confirmation of its self-declaration
            by a party external to the organization; or seeking
            certification/registration of its SMS by an external organization.

            the organization 4.1 Understanding the organization and its context
            The organization shall determine, monitor and review external and
            internal issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction that
            affect its ability to achieve the intended outcome(s) of its SMS.
            NOTE 1 External and internal issues can include positive and
            negative factors or conditions. NOTE 2 Understanding of the external
            context can be facilitated by determining issues arising from legal,
            technological, competitive, market, cultural, social and economic
            environments, whether international, national, regional or local.
            NOTE 3 Understanding of the internal context can be facilitated by
            determining issues related to values, culture, knowledge and
            performance of the organization. 4.2 Understanding the needs and
            expectations of interested parties To provide products and services
            that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory
            requirements, the organization shall determine: the interested
            parties relevant to the SMS; and the requirements of interested
            parties relevant to the SMS. The organization shall monitor and
            review information concerning interested parties and their relevant
            requirements. 4.3 Determining the scope of the SMS The organization
            shall determine the boundaries and applicability of the SMS to
            establish its scope. The organization shall determine the: external
            and internal issues in accordance with 4.1; the requirements of
            relevant interested parties in accordance with 4.2; and the products
            and services impacted by the SMS. The scope of the organization’s
            SMS shall be accessible to all relevant interested parties and
            maintained as documented information. It shall state the types of
            products and services covered and provide justification for any

            2 A periodic review of necessary competence should be carried out.
            NOTE 3 Applicable actions can include, for example, the provision of
            training to, the mentoring of, or the reassignment of currently
            employed persons, or the hiring or contracting of competent persons.
            7.7 SM awareness Any worker(s) performing activities under the
            organization’s control shall be aware of: the SM policy; relevant
            standardization objectives; their contribution to the effectiveness
            of the SMS, including the benefits of improved performance; the
            implications of not conforming to the SMS requirements; and relevant
            SMS documented information and changes thereto. 7.8 Communication
            The organization shall determine the internal and external
            communications relevant to the SMS, including: what it will
            communicate; when to communicate; with whom to communicate; how to
            communicate; and who communicates. NOTE Communication should include

            information 7.9.1 General The organization’s SMS shall include
            documented information: in accordance with this British Standard;
            and determined by the organization as being necessary for the
            effectiveness of the SMS. NOTE The extent of documented information
            for an SMS can differ from one organization to another due to: the
            size of organization and its activities, processes, products and
            services; the complexity of processes and their interactions; and
            the competence of persons. 7.9.2 Creating and updating The
            organization’s documented information shall include: identification
            and description (e.g. title, date, author or reference number);
            format (e.g. language, software version, graphics) and media (e.g.
            paper, electronic); and a review and approval for suitability and
            adequacy. 7.10 Control of documented information The organization
            shall have a process for controlling documented information which
            includes, as applicable: distribution, access, retrieval and use;
            storage and preservation, including preservation of legibility;
            control of changes (e.g. version control); and retention and

            selection of standards The organization shall have a defined order
            of preference for the selection of standards contained within its SM
            policy. NOTE Attention is drawn to the Public Contracts Regulations
            2015 and Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011,
            with regard to the order of preference for standard selection. See
            also [BS EN 16341]. 8.3 Reasons for selection of standards The
            selection of standards shall provide assurance for the design,
            manufacture and ongoing support of the organization’s products and
            services. Standards selected shall be derived to meet: legislative
            requirements; regulatory requirements; safety requirements;
            environmental requirements; design, manufacturing and ongoing
            support; and contractual requirements. 8.4 Obtaining standards The
            organization shall have an approved methodology for obtaining
            relevant standards. NOTE Examples of methods for obtaining standards
            include: internet search engines; standards development
            organizations; and other standards service delivery organizations.
            8.5 Capturing the standards to meet contract/project requirements
            8.5.1 Initial listing A suitable method for capturing standards
            identified in the contract or project, including configuration
            management control, shall be implemented, e.g. a standardization
            management plan (SMP), a spreadsheet or a simple list of the
            relevant standards. The method used shall include, as a minimum:
            standard reference number; standard title; part number reference (if
            appropriate); edition/issue reference or alternative; version
            reference (if appropriate); publication date; and standard status,
            e.g. current, active, extant, stabilized. NOTE 1 Withdrawn,
            cancelled or draft standards should not be referenced in contracts.
            NOTE 2 Additional useful information that could be captured
            includes: reason for selection; and who selected the standard.
            8.5.2 Tailoring, trading and agreeing the list of standards The
            initial list of standards shall be negotiated, tailored and traded,
            as appropriate, and agreed between the purchaser and supplier. Any
            changes to the list shall be captured and justified, as appropriate.
            The list of agreed standards shall be reviewed to ensure that: the
            technical, commercial and financial details given within the
            documentation are acceptable to the organization; an assessment
            report is made available, demonstrating the applicability of each
            standard, if appropriate; and an approval document is generated and
            coordinated by the appropriate parties across the organization (this
            could include programmes, sales, commercial, finance and legal).
            8.5.3 Monitoring the currency of selected standards An appropriate
            process for monitoring the status of standards shall be established,
            which could include: setting up watch lists; regular list reviews
            (e.g. SMP); contract validations of standards (and if appropriate
            contract renegotiations); and a policy for the use of standards that
            have changed status. 8.6 Assurance and validation of standards
            COMMENTARY ON 8.6 An organization can perform one or more of the
            activities specified in this subclause at various times throughout
            the product life cycle. 8.6.1 Assurance The organization shall
            detail how it is to provide assurance regarding the standards that
            have been selected for the contract/project, including the people
            responsible for providing the assurance and the method(s) by which
            this assurance is to be provided, including: SM standardization
            management committee(s); governance and control procedures;
            provision of assurance letters or references; and assessment of
            standards (see 8.5.3). 8.6.2 Validation To validate the list of
            standards, including contracted standards, the organization shall
            determine a secure method of access, in accordance with 8.5.1.
            NOTE This could be as simple as reviewing an A to Z list of
            standards used across the organization, or a list of contracted
            standards agreed in support of the products and services or products
            provided by the organization. 9 Performance evaluation of the SMS
            9.1 Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation 9.1.1 General

            measurement, analysis and evaluation required to produce valid
            results; determine when the monitoring and measuring are to be
            performed; and determine when the results from monitoring and
            measurement are to be analysed and evaluated. The organization shall
            evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the SMS. The
            organization shall retain appropriate documented information as
            evidence (see 7.9). 9.1.2 Customer satisfaction The organization
            shall monitor customer perception of the degree to which their needs
            and expectations have been fulfilled. The organization shall
            determine the methods for obtaining, monitoring and reviewing this
            information. NOTE Examples of monitoring customer perception can
            include customer surveys, customer feedback on delivered products
            and services, meetings with customers, market-share analysis,
            compliments, warranty claims and dealer reports. Information to be
            monitored and used for the evaluation of customer satisfaction shall
            include, but is not limited to: product and service conformity;
            on-time delivery performance; customer complaints; and corrective
            action requests. The organization shall develop and implement plans
            for customer satisfaction improvement that address deficiencies
            identified by these evaluations and assess the effectiveness of the
            results. 9.1.3 Analysis and evaluation The organization shall
            analyse and evaluate relevant data and information arising from
            monitoring and measurement. NOTE 1 Relevant data can include
            information on product and service problems reported by external
            sources (e.g. government/industry alerts, advisories). The results
            of analysis shall be used to evaluate: conformity of products and
            services; the degree of customer satisfaction; the performance and
            effectiveness of the SMS; whether planning has been implemented
            effectively; the effectiveness of actions taken to address risks and
            opportunities; the performance of external providers; and the need
            for improvements to the SMS. NOTE 2 Methods to analyse data can
            include statistical techniques. 9.2 Internal audit 9.2.1 General The
            organization shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to:
            provide information on whether the SMS conforms to: the
            organization’s requirements for its SMS; and NOTE 1 The

            documented information as evidence of: the nature of the
            nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken; and any corrective
            action taken and its results. Annex A (informative) Standardization
            manager terms of reference A.1 General A standardization manager is
            responsible for the successful implementation of SM. SM is the
            through-life process that enables the drafting, development and
            maintenance of standards. It promotes the intelligent selection and
            implementation of standards, policy, process and tools. A.2 Purpose
            To be the organization’s focal point for SM, including its
            implementation across the organization. A.3 Tasks A standardization
            manager is responsible for: employing best practice in SM by using
            appropriate processes and tools; maintaining regular contact with
            other standardization managers through peer group interaction and
            supporting the standardization user community; creating,
            implementing and updating the organization’s SM policy, in
            conjunction with the various stakeholders; standards configuration
            control, including the recording and referencing of negotiated
            tailored and traded standards; ensuring the SM process is assured
            against the organizational policy; ensuring standards are selected
            in accordance with the organization’s selection policy; providing
            assistance to other members of the organization in relation to
            identifying interface/interdependency issues with respect to SM;
            ensuring that links are established between the standards used and
            the requirements within the contract and that they are recorded on
            the configuration control system; confirming the status,
            availability and access of standards; validating the status of the
            standard(s) selected by the organization in support of the product
            and/or service; monitoring relevant legislation/regulations which
            might affect standards and SM, and work toward providing solutions;
            providing advice and guidance on SM; and identifying and managing
            risks and their mitigation in the appropriate risk register. Annex B
            (informative) SM committee terms of reference The SM committee is a
            group of suitably qualified and experienced persons (SQEP), rather
            than a title or position, providing informed guidance about SM for
            the contract or project, whilst supporting the project aims with
            respect to cost, schedule, capability, quality and safety. The SM
            committee provides additional value to the project in a guidance
            role whilst sharing informed ideas and activities with respect to SM
            across the organization. Decisions made within the committee
            structure inform the hierarchy of issues and potential solutions
            alongside creating an appropriate audit trail. The SM committee
            provides suitable representation from across the organization to
            appropriately analyse SM. In order to achieve this, the SM
            committee’s basic functions are to: review and comment on the
            applicability of standards data compiled and presented by the
            standardization manager; review, as appropriate, specification
            documents that link project requirements and acceptance to the
            applicable standards; inform the committee of SM issues that affect
            individual areas of design activity, including references to
            appropriate specification documents that link project requirements
            and acceptance to the applicable standards; meet regularly during
            the project life cycle; provide written summary reports on SM issues
            that affect individual areas of responsibility for those unable to
            attend meetings in person or provide other suitable representation;
            remain flexible in responding to ad hoc meeting requests required to
            provide information in specific design areas; recognize the mutual
            assurance activities of SM whilst supporting the requirement to
            align standards, including interface requirements; and provide
            minutes, outcomes and details of meetings to representative areas in
            a timely and appropriate manner. Annex C (informative) Recognized
